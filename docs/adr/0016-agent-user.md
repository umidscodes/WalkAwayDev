# The agent user: its own macOS user, its own login, pinned to its home

Date: 2026-11-08. Status: built (step 4, 2026-11-08: the box removed, `omp` switched to the agent user, the backup moved to the agent home). Owner decision of 2026-11-08: remove the containers; the agent runs as its own macOS user, and damage stays in that user's home. The login, the pin, and the backup ran on the owner's mac (Open; Step 4). This ADR supersedes `0013-agent-box.md`, `0014-session-containers.md`, and `0015-box-layout.md`. The checklist of every row is `../THREAT-MODEL.md`.

## Context

The box keeps the agent in a Linux VM. It costs a Linux image and a second omp pin (`VERSIONS`: `box_omp`), an undocumented `--network none` (`0013-agent-box.md`, "Cost"), a relay inside the box, and a backup that reads the home through the VM (`../THREAT-MODEL.md`, U37). The harm the owner wants walled is harm to the owner's own files, logins, and desktop. A second macOS user walls files by plain permissions; the owner's runs of 2026-11-08 show where it does not, and what closes each gap (the agent user rows of `../THREAT-MODEL.md`).

## Decision (proposed)

The base is three things:

1. **The owner's home is closed.** Mode 700. A new standard user is in the group `staff`, as the owner is (`Assigning UID: 502 GID: 20`), and with the owner's home at the macOS default it read the owner's files; with mode 700 it could not read, write, or reopen it (owner runs, 2026-11-08). Setup sets it, and a start refuses if it is open.
2. **The agent's files are pinned to its home.** A sandbox profile, run with `sandbox-exec`, allows writes only in the agent's home, its own temp folder under `/private/var/folders`, `/dev/null`, and the terminal devices, and allows reads only of its home and the system folders that programs need to run. Reads are an allow list, not a list of denied places, so a path nobody listed stays closed. Under it, over ssh, `/tmp`, `/Users/Shared`, and `/Volumes` were closed, and git, a commit, and omp ran (owner run, 2026-11-08; the agent user rows of `../THREAT-MODEL.md`). The profile as run on 2026-11-08, with the agent's home for `/Users/ugtest` (the current, narrower one is `host/agent/pin.sb`):

   ```
   (version 1)
   (allow default)
   (deny file-read* (require-not (require-any
     (literal "/") (literal "/Users") (literal "/private") (literal "/private/var")
     (literal "/etc") (literal "/tmp") (literal "/var")
     (subpath "/Users/ugtest")
     (subpath "/System") (subpath "/usr") (subpath "/bin") (subpath "/sbin")
     (subpath "/Library") (subpath "/Applications") (subpath "/dev")
     (subpath "/private/etc") (subpath "/private/var/db/timezone") (literal "/private/var/db/xcode_select_link")
     (subpath "/private/var/select") (subpath "/private/var/run") (subpath "/private/var/folders"))))
   (allow file-read-metadata)
   (deny file-write* (require-not (subpath "/Users/ugtest")))
   (allow file-write* (literal "/dev/null") (regex #"^/dev/tty") (subpath "/private/var/folders"))
   ```

3. **The agent starts through a login of its own.** Not with `sudo -u` from the owner's terminal: started that way, it read the owner's clipboard (owner run, 2026-11-08). Logged in over ssh to `localhost`, with the profile and no rule per service, it did not read the clipboard, Apple events failed, and `open -a TextEdit` failed with no app started (owner run, 2026-11-08).

Around the base:

- **No containers.** No Apple `container` VM, image, volume, or relay.
- **A standard user, never an admin,** made by setup, hidden from the login window. The owner never logs in as it at the desktop.
- **One home, on omp's defaults,** with the repo clones in it, cloned through the gh-broker. Sessions are one trust level and share it (`0011-one-agent-arena.md`, "One trust level").
- **No network wall for now** (owner decision, 2026-11-08). U3, U7, and U14 are accepted by name.
- **No secret on a command line.** Any user sees the owner's processes with their full arguments (owner run, 2026-11-08), and the pin could not hide them.

## Open

- The login ran on the owner's mac on 2026-11-08: `ug-agent` started a session as `ugagent` through the agent's own sshd (`host/agent/sshd_config`, LaunchDaemon `com.underground.agent-sshd`, `127.0.0.1:2222`, key only, forced to `agent-session`). In it, the model answered, `gh-broker sync IsrafilEMIN/underground-public` printed `origin/main is now 922ff3d8…`, and `pbpaste` printed nothing (exit 1).
- The system Remote Login may run, so the owner's phone can reach the mac (owner, 2026-11-08). Setup writes `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/010-underground-deny-ugagent.conf` with `DenyUsers ugagent`, then checks the effective config with `sshd -T` and stops if it does not deny `ugagent` (`host/bin/ug-agent-setup`). While Remote Login runs, `ug-agent` runs the same `sshd -T` check of `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and refuses unless it prints `DenyUsers ugagent` (`host/bin/ug-agent`). `sshd -T` needs no root when `-o HostKey` names a key the caller can read; `ug-agent` passes the owner's agent key. As `ugagent` on 2026-11-08, `sshd -T -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config -o HostKey=<temp key>` printed the effective config. `tests/host/ug-agent.test.ts` checks that a `DenyUsers ugagent` in an `Include`d file passes and that its absence refuses. `DenyUsers` lines add up rather than replace each other: for a test config with the lines `DenyUsers alice` and `DenyUsers ugagent bob`, `sshd -T` printed `DenyUsers alice`, `DenyUsers ugagent`, `DenyUsers bob`, one per line. This macOS sshd prints keywords in mixed case, so both checks match without case. The check of Remote Login is `launchctl print system/com.openssh.sshd`.
- Setup adds `ugagent` to `com.apple.access_ssh`, which the system sshd needed in the owner's run (`Connection closed by ::1 port 22` before the add). Whether the agent's sshd checks the group is [inference]; setup adds it anyway.
- `/Users/ugagent/.ssh` is root-owned and holds an empty `authorized_keys`, for the system sshd. The agent's own sshd reads keys only from its file in the folder `/Library/Underground/code/authorized_keys/` (`/Library/Underground/authorized_keys/` until 2026-11-10) (`AuthorizedKeysFile` in `host/agent/sshd_config`; `host/bin/ug-agent-setup` writes `ugagent`). The agent owns its home, so root ownership alone does not stop a rename of `~/.ssh`; the pin does: in a pinned session on 2026-11-08, `mv .ssh .ssh-probe` failed with `Operation not permitted`, the sandbox's error, and `.ssh` stayed. `DenyUsers ugagent` is the lock that holds even outside the pin.
- Changed 2026-11-09: setup makes `/Users/ugagent/.ssh` only when it makes the user, and later only reads its owner and mode (`agent_is_new` in `host/bin/ug-agent-setup`). Before, setup ran `install` as root on that path at each run. The agent owns the home, so outside the pin it could put a link there, and root would follow it. The system sshd's `DenyUsers ugagent` does not need the folder.
- Code before the pin: the agent's login shell is `/bin/sh`, which reads no start file when sshd runs it with `-c` [inference, bash manual: a non-interactive shell invoked as `sh` reads no startup files; on macOS `/bin/sh` runs the shell named in `/private/var/select/sh`]. The pin also denies writes to the zsh and bash start files in the home, and `PermitUserRC no` stops sshd from running `~/.ssh/rc` (`host/agent/sshd_config`).
- launchd: the pin denies `/bin/launchctl`, `/usr/bin/at`, `/usr/bin/crontab`, `/usr/bin/batch` (`host/agent/pin.sb`). Owner run, 2026-11-08, as `ugagent` under the pin with `sudo -u`: a copy of `/bin/launchctl` in the home was killed at once (`Killed: 9` for `./lc submit` and `./lc remove`), and the job's file `/tmp/ug-esc` did not appear. [inference] macOS kills a copied system binary that carries Apple-only rights. A program that talks to launchd directly, with no `launchctl`, is not tested.
- A full run to a merge, from a session on the agent user, 2026-11-08: commit, `gh-broker push`, `gh-broker pr-create`, green CI, and the owner's merge of #102 to #105. A plain subagent of that session (`task`), 2026-11-08: `id -un` printed `ugagent`, it read a repo file, `gh-broker pr-status` worked, it wrote a file in its `$TMPDIR`, and `touch /tmp/subagent-escape` printed `Permission denied`. Not run: an isolated subagent, which omp makes in its own copy of the worktree.
- The gh-broker socket moved to `/Library/Underground/run/gh-broker.sock` (`socketPath` in `host/gh-broker/server.ts`), 0666 after it listens (`listenUnix` in `host/gh-broker/server.ts`, as it was before the change below). The folder `run/` is owned by the owner, mode 0711. `gh-broker sync` from the agent user worked (above).
- Changed 2026-11-09, not run on the owner's mac: the socket is 0660 and the folder `run/` is owned by the owner, group `ugagent`, mode 0710 (`listenUnix` in `host/gh-broker/server.ts`; `agent_group` in `host/bin/ug-agent-setup`), so no other user of the mac can connect. The agent sshd keeps no pid file (`PidFile` in `host/agent/sshd_config`), so root writes nothing in the owner's folder.
- The model door: setup writes `/Library/Underground/config` with the gateway's real address and bearer in `models.yml`. The bearer sits in a file the agent can read [it already could use the gateway; U30 accepted].
- No disk cap (U22): owner decision, 2026-11-08, not needed.
- The pin's read list, trimmed by an owner run on 2026-11-08. Each variant ran a workload as `ugagent` under `sandbox-exec` (shell, git status and commit, python3, an HTTPS request, time zone, `gh-broker pr-status`, an omp model call, node, npm, gh). Needed: `/private/etc` (without it, `https` failed: `configuration file routines:CRYPTO_internal:system lib`) and `/private/var/db/timezone` (without it, `timezone` failed). Each of these passed when removed on its own, and is now removed: `/Applications`, `/private/var/db/xcode_select_link`, `/private/var/select`, `/private/var/run`, and the `/etc`, `/tmp`, `/var` links. `/Library` is narrowed to `Underground`, `Developer`, `Preferences`, and `Apple`: everything passed, and `ls "/Library/Application Support"` failed, as it should. Homebrew: its `bin`, `Cellar`, `opt`, `lib`, `libexec`, and `share` are readable, and its `var` and `etc` stay closed. In the combined pin npm first failed with `calling fopen(/opt/homebrew/etc/openssl@4/openssl.cnf, rb)`, `Operation not permitted`. So the pin allows the one file `openssl.cnf` under any `/opt/homebrew/etc/openssl@<n>/`. Owner run of the full pin, 2026-11-08, with and without the OpenSSL and CA `cert.pem` files: every check passed both times, `npm view left-pad version` included, so the certificate files are not allowed.
- Changed 2026-11-10 (owner decision, `0024-state-over-incident-lists.md`): the read allow list is gone. The pin denies reads only under `/Volumes`; the owner's home (mode 700) and root's home (mode 750, group `wheel`) stay closed by the agent user's file rights. The installed pin is `/Library/Underground/code/pin.sb`.
- The owner's leftover files in `/tmp`: the tool that writes each fixed name moves to a private folder before the files are deleted, so the agent cannot plant one at the same name. With the pin, the agent cannot write `/tmp` at all.

## Rejected

- The box: the costs under Context.
- A pin that lists denied places: a place nobody listed stays open.
- A start with `sudo -u` from the owner's terminal: it shares the owner's desktop session (Decision, 3).
- An admin agent user: it can run `sudo`.
- A root LaunchDaemon for the backup: it would run the owner's `wake=` and `sleep=` lines as root, and it would need the owner's ssh key and known_hosts where root reads them.

## Cost

- No network wall (U3, U7, U14).
- The agent shares the owner's kernel; a local privilege escalation in macOS reaches the owner.
- `sandbox-exec` is marked deprecated by Apple [inference, from its manual page], and srt runs on the same mechanism; a macOS update can change it.
- Code planted in the agent's home loads in later sessions until a rebuild.

## Step 4 (2026-11-08): the switch

- `omp` on `PATH` was `~/.ug/sys/bin/omp`, linked to `ug-agent` by `host/bin/ug-agent-setup`. Since `0017-one-omp-binary-and-no-ug-folder.md` it is `~/.local/bin/omp`, and `~/.ug` is gone.
- The box is removed: `host/bin/ug-box`, `host/bin/ug-box-restore`, `host/bin/ug-box-check.ts`, `host/lib/box-image.bash`, `box/`, `host/egress/`, `host/srt/`, `host/network-allowlist`, the `com.underground.egress` LaunchAgent, and the `srt`, `box_omp`, and `ovnfs` pins in `VERSIONS`. Setup removed the old installed copies and the egress LaunchAgent in a one-time step, which is gone since the owner's mac ran it (owner, 2026-11-08). It never touched the volume `ug-box-home` or the images; the owner deletes those by hand.
- The backup stays the owner's LaunchAgent `com.underground.backup`, at 20:00. `host/bin/ug-backup` takes the agent home from a root helper through sudo: `/Library/Underground/bin/agent-home-tar` (`host/agent/agent-home-tar`, which runs tar on `/Users/ugagent` and excludes `./.cache` and `node_modules`). The owner's rule is `/etc/sudoers.d/underground-backup`, written by `ug-agent-setup` and checked with `visudo -cf`. restic reads the tar stream with `--stdin-from-command`, so a failed read stores no snapshot. `.ug-nobackup` is no longer honored.
- Owner run, 2026-11-08: `ug-agent-setup` printed `backup: /Library/Underground/bin/agent-home-tar, and sudo for <owner> to run it`, `ug-backup` printed `BACKUP OK`, and the `ug-agent` snapshot has `"total_bytes_processed":4207872000`. tar also reported `pax format cannot archive sockets` for `./.omp/run/daemons/…/broker.sock`, `Could not pack extended attributes: Operation not supported`, and `./Library/Caches/com.apple.containermanagerd: Couldn't visit directory: Operation not permitted`, then `Error exit delayed from previous errors`. The helper now passes `--no-xattrs` and leaves out `./.omp/run` (live sockets) and `./Library` (macOS's own folders for the user; a run as `ugagent` also hit `./Library/ContainerManager: Couldn't visit directory`). The same tar run as `ugagent`, 2026-11-08: `tar exit 0, warning lines: 0`, 4198952960 bytes. It still counts tar's exit 1 as a success: the agent chooses what sits in its home, and a socket, FIFO, or unreadable folder of its own must not stop every backup. A missed file shows in `backup.log`, and the watch reports a last good backup older than 36 hours (`0023-failures-reach-the-owner.md`).
- Restore of a box snapshot (the box's home volume): `restic -r <repo> dump <id> ug-box-home.tar | sudo tar -x -C /Users/ugagent --exclude .omp/natives`, then `sudo env BUN_BE_BUN=1 <omp> host/agent/migrate-paths.ts /Users/ugagent /home/agent /Users/ugagent`, then `sudo chown -R ugagent:staff /Users/ugagent`. The migration moves the session header `cwd` and the `history` and `session_recaps` rows under the old home (`tests/host/migrate-paths.test.ts`).
- Restore of an agent snapshot: `restic -r <repo> dump <id> ug-agent-home.tar | sudo tar -x -C /Users/ugagent`, then `sudo chown -R ugagent:staff /Users/ugagent`. This writes over the live home. The snapshot is a tar stream, so `restic restore` would leave the tar file unpacked.
- Restore test, without a write to the live home: `restic -r <repo> dump --tag ug-agent latest ug-agent-home.tar | tar -x -C ~/ug-restore-test`, as the owner, with `RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE` set to the backup password. Owner run, 2026-11-08: snapshot `00d138bc` gave `.omp/agent/history.db`, `agent.db`, and `sessions/`, and no `models.yml`. The owner deletes the folder afterwards: it holds a full copy of the agent home.
- Open, 2026-11-08: after the restore test, the owner's `sleep=` command printed that the machine was asleep, but the backup machine stayed awake (owner). The cause is not known; the command is in the owner's config, which the agent cannot read. The nightly job runs the same command after it wakes the machine.
- Open, 2026-11-08: the helper tars the SQLite files (`history.db`, `agent.db`, `models.db`) and their `-wal` files while omp writes them, with no checkpoint or `.backup` first. Owner run, 2026-11-08, on the restore of snapshot `00d138bc`: `PRAGMA integrity_check` printed `ok` for all three, and a session file from before the snapshot had the same SHA-256 as the live copy (`980f4dfd…`). One pass does not show that every live copy comes back whole.
